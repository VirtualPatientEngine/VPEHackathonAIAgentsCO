## 1. Productivity
- How productive was your team?
- How productive were the teams that your team helped?

## 2. Task challenge

- How well did your team incorporate the expanded use cases?
- How well were the task challenges aligned with the coaches instructions?

## 3. Innovation
- Did your team come up with a super cool solution that we did not think of?
- Did your team find another use case not directly stated in the task challenge that provides value?

## 4. Reproducibility
- Is there sufficient documentation to repeat what your team did?
- Are there examples to demonstrate the new functionality that your team added?
- Are there tests that we can use to verify the new functionality works?
