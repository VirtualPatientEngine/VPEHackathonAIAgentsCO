# <font color=black>Setup for AI agents for life sciences</font>
> <font color=black>ℹ️</font><br>
> **Date** 2024-10-14 to -15<br>
> **Location** BioLabs Heidelberg and Online<br>

## Infrastructure and core software
- Cloud infrastructure: [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/de/)
- Computational research platform: [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/)
- Version control: [GitHub](https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine)
- AI Agent application requirements: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)

### 1 Computational research platform with Code Ocean
1. View a [short overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_qddEpTEjo) of the Code Ocean platform
2. Review further information in the Code Ocean [user guide](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide) if needed

> <font color=black>💡tips</font><br>
> 1. Use the `Scratch` folder for downloading large data files<br>
> 2. Use the VS Code editor to launch the Ollama server, interact with Streamlit, and code 

### 2 Version control with GitHub for simultaneous capsule collaboration
1. Navigate to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine/VPEHackathonAIAgentsCO)
2. Each team will create their own fork called "team XXX"
3. Each team member will create their own capsule `create a new capsule` through the option `clone from VirtualPatientEngine`
4. After team members update their capsules branch, members should `push` to their teams branch
5. Each team member then updates their capsules with their team members contributions by `pulling` to their capsules branch

> <font color=black>💡tips</font><br>
> 1. Use the command line `terminal` in the VS Code editor for pushing and pulling using `git`<br>
> 2. Quick reference of [git commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-cheat-sheet/) if you forget and the [full documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git) if typing `git --help` is not sufficient
